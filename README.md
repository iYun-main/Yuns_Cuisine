This mod was bound to a Minecraft Nation / Faction Server 
it updating to the newest update was only gonna happen when the Server Owner of said server Updates to 1.21.X
However we since then freed ourselves from the Shackels of Despair and Horrible Treatment of the Server Owner and its Former Staff. 
The Mod will now follow its own Path and Update timeline
